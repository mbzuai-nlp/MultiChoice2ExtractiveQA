This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you. If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.

Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated at a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water may form there. Most deaths happen as result of fatigue trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible. As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normally. Try aiming somewhere where you are not caught again or, depending on your skills and on whether you have been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.",What should you do if you get caught in a current?,eng_Latn,05/03/2023,"Try to get out of the current by aiming in another direction, then swim back to shore normally",X,No

Anonymous,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Wildlife_photography,1,"Wildlife is among the most challenging motifs for a photographer, and needs a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment. Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but like photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words. Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, though things like a flock of birds or a tiny creature need other lenses.
